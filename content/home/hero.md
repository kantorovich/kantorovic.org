The Kantorovich Initiative is dedicated towards research and dissemination of modern mathematics of optimal transport towards a wide audience of researchers, students, industry, policy makers and the general public. To know more about optimal transport, check out the <span style="text-decoration:underline">[wiki](https://otwiki.xyz)</span> created by students at UC Santa Barbara and maintained by Katy Craig. Contributions are welcome! <span style="text-decoration:underline">https://otwiki.xyz</span>

The group was convened by [Young-Heon Kim (University of British Columbia)](/authors/yhkim/), [Soumik Pal (University of Washington)](/authors/soumik/) and [Brendan Pass (University of Alberta)](/authors/pass/), with support from the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](http://www.pims.math.ca/).
