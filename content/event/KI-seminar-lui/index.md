  In this talk, we introduce some recent regularity results of free boundary in
  optimal transportation. Particularly for higher order regularity, when
  densities are HÃ¶lder continuous and domains are C^2, uniformly convex, we
  obtain the free boundary is C^{2,alpha} smooth. We also consider another model
  case that the target consists of two disjoint convex sets, in which
  singularities of optimal transport mapping arise. Under similar assumptions,
  we show that the singular set of the optimal mapping is an (n-1)-dimensional
  C^{2,alpha} regular sub-manifold of R^n. These are based on a series of joint
  work with Shibing Chen and Xu-Jia Wang.
