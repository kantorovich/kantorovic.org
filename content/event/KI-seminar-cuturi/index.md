abstract: |
  I will introduce our recent work on parameterising OT problems with
  elastic costs, i.e. ground costs that mix the classic squared
  Euclidean distance with a regularizer (e.g. L1 norm). After
  highlighting the properties of OT maps that follow such costs, I
  will present a method to compute ground truth OT maps with elastic
  costs and also a method to learn the parameters, adaptively, of such
  a regularizer.
