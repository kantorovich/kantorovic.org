  Detecting differences and building classifiers between distributions, 
  given only finite samples, are important tasks in a number of scientific 
  fields. Optimal transport (OT) has evolved as the most natural concept to
  measure the distance between distributions and has gained significant 
  importance in machine learning in recent years. There are some drawbacks 
  to OT: computing OT can be slow, and it often fails to exploit reduced 
  complexity in case the family of distributions is generated by simple group 
  actions.

  If we make no assumptions on the family of distributions, these drawbacks are 
  difficult to overcome. However, in the case that the measures are generated 
  by push-forwards by elementary transformations, forming a low-dimensional 
  submanifold of the Wasserstein manifold, we can deal with both of these issues 
  on a theoretical and on a computational level. In this talk, weâ€™ll show how to 
  embed the space of distributions into a Hilbert space via linearized optimal 
  transport (LOT), and how linear techniques can be used to classify different 
  families of distributions generated by elementary transformations and perturbations. 
  The proposed framework significantly reduces both the computational effort and
  the required training data in supervised learning settings. We demonstrate the
  algorithms in pattern recognition tasks in imaging and provide some medical applications.

  This is joint work with Alex Cloninger, Keaton Hamm, Harish Kannan, Varun Khurana, 
  and Jinjie Zhang.
