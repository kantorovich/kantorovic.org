  Our introduction of the notion of a non-linear Kantorovich operator was motivated by the celebrated duality in the mass transport problem, hence the name. In           retrospect, we realized that they -and their iterates- were omnipresent in several branches of analysis, even those that are focused on linear Markov operators and     their semi-groups such as classical ergodic theory, potential theory, and probability theory. The Kantorovich operators that appear in these cases, though non-         linear, are all positively 1-homogenous rendering most classical operations on measures and functions conducted in these theories ``cost-free”: From ``filling         schemes" in ergodic theory, to ``balayage of measures" in potential theory, to dynamic programming of ``gambling houses" in probability theory. General Kantorovich     operators arise when one assigns ``a cost" to such operations. 

  Kantorovich operators are also Choquet capacities and are the ``least non-linear" extensions of Markov operators, which make them a relatively ``manageable” subclass   of non-linear maps, where they play the same role that convex envelopes play for numerical functions. Motivated by the stochastic counterpart of  Aubry-Mather theory   for Lagrangian systems and Fathi-Mather weak KAM theory, as well as ergodic optimization of dynamical systems, we study the asymptotic properties of general           Kantorovich operators.
