abstract: |
  The optimal transport problem provides a fundamental and quantitative way to
  measure the distance between probability distributions.  Recently, it has been
  successfully used to analyze the evolutionary dynamics in physics and biology.
  Motivated by questions of pricing in financial mathematics and control of
  distributed agents, stochastic variants of optimal transport have been
  developed.  Over the past few years, my postdoc supervisors at the University of
  British Columbia (Nassif Ghoussoub and Young-Heon Kim) and I have developed a
  robust method to analyze these problems using convex duality, stochastic optimal
  control theory, and partial differential equation analysis.
  
  
  This talk will focus on these variants of optimal transport, their applications,
  and our methods of analysis.  Particular attention will be paid to the
  connections with mean field games and to a new direction of research that
  incorporates the practical limitation of partial information.
