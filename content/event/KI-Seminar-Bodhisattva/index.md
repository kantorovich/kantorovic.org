abstract: |
  The sign test (Arbuthnott, 1710) and the Wilcoxon
  signed-rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945) are among the first examples of a
  nonparametric test. These procedures --- based on signs, (absolute)
  ranks and signed-ranks --- yield distribution-free tests for symmetry
  in one-dimension. However, multivariate distribution-free
  generalizations of these tests are not known in the literature. In
  this talk we propose a novel framework --- based on the theory of
  optimal transport --- which leads to distribution-free generalized
  multivariate signs, ranks and signed-ranks, and, as a consequence to
  analogues of the sign and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests that share many
  of the appealing properties of their one-dimensional counterparts. In
  particular, the proposed tests are exactly distribution-free in finite
  samples, with an asymptotic normal distribution, and adapt to various
  notions of multivariate symmetry such as central symmetry, sign
  symmetry, and spherical symmetry. We study the consistency of the
  proposed tests and their behaviors under local alternatives, and show
  that the proposed generalized Wilcoxon signed-rank test is
  particularly powerful against location shift alternatives. We show
  that in a large class of models, our generalized Wilcoxon signed-rank
  test suffers from no loss in (asymptotic) efficiency, when compared to
  the Hotelling's T^2 test, despite being nonparametric and exactly
  distribution-free. These ideas can also be used to construct
  distribution-free confidence sets for the location parameter for
  multivariate distributions.
