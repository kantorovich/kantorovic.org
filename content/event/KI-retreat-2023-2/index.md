  title="Duality and free boundaries for optimal nonlinear pricing"
  author="Robert McCann"

The principal-agent problem is an important paradigm in economic theory
for studying the value of private information;  the nonlinear pricing problem
faced by a monopolist is one example; others include optimal taxation and auction design.
For multidimensional spaces of consumers (i.e. agents) and products, Rochet and Chon\'e (1998)   
reformulated this problem to a concave maximization over the set of convex functions,
by assuming agent preferences combine bilinearity in the product and agent parameters with a (quasi)linear sensitivity to prices.
We characterize solutions to this problem by identifying a dual minimization problem.  This duality allows us to reduce
the solution of the square example of Rochet-Chon\'e to a novel free boundary problem,  giving the first analytical description
of an overlooked market segment.

  title="Quantifying Distributional Model Risk in Relaxed Marginal Problems via Optimal Transport"
  author="Gaoqian Xu"
  affiliation="UW"
>}}
This paper studies distributional model risk in relaxed marginal problems, where each marginal measure is assumed to lie in a Wasserstein ball of a given radius and centered at a fixed marginal reference measure. Theoretically, we establish strong duality, continuity, and finiteness of the proposed distributional model risk function (of radius), as well as the existence of an optimizer for each radius. Practically, we illustrate our results on four distinct applications when the sample information comes from multiple data sources and only marginal reference measures are identified. They are: partial identification of treatment effects; externally valid treatment choice via robust welfare functions; Wasserstein distributionally robust estimation under data combination; and evaluation of the worst aggregate risk measures.

  title="Curvature on Combinatorial Graphs via Wasserstein Geometry"
  author="Stefan Steinerberger"
  affiliation="UW"
>}}
We will discuss ways of defining a notion of curvature on combinatorial
graphs.  One of the classical and most canonical ways of doing it is the Ollivier 
curvature that defines curvature via Optimal Transport.  I will discuss some more 
recent ideas and a very simple notion that is extremely easy to compute (one 
linear system of equations) and has many of the same properties.
