## Overview

In the fall term of 2023, [Soumik Pal](/authors/soumik) (UW) and [Young-Heon
Kim](/authors/yhkim) (UBC), will offer a graduate course on Optimal
Transport + Gradient Flows.  This course is part of the [PIMS Network Wide
Graduate Courses](https://courses.pims.math.ca) program and will be accessible
remotely.  Students in the PIMS network of Universities will be able to register
for credit through the Western Deans Agreement.

This course is on the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows based on the formal
Riemannian calculus due to Otto. Apart from the classical examples, we will also
discuss many modern variations such as Wasserstein mirror gradient flows that
come up in applications. A fruitful interaction between probability, geometry,
and PDE theory will be developed simultaneously.


### Delivery Details

The course is being offered simultaneously at Korea Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST) and the PIMS network, including the University of
Washington, Seattle. **Due to different time schedules for individual campuses and
the time zones, the course has an unusual structure. Please read the details
below carefully.**


#### Professors
  * Young-Heon Kim (UBC and KAIST) <yhkim@math.ubc.ca>
  * Soumik Pal (UW) <soumikpal@gmail.com>

#### Lectures
* Lecture hours **6:30pm - 8pm Pacific on Tuesdays and Thursdays**. Thus we will
have two classes per week, each for 90 mins.

* Lectures will be taught over Zoom and videos and notes will be made available to
everyone afterwards.

* A Slack channel will be used to communicate with students and distribute
teaching material.

There will be no exams in this course. Occasional homework problems will be
provided.

#### Registration
Canadian PIMS students can register through the [Western Deans
Agreement](http://wcdgs.ca/western-deans-agreement.html) as course **Math
606D:101** at UBC. Please see the PIMS Network wide courses
webpage](https://courses.pims.math.ca) for more information about the WDA and
registration deadlines at various universities. UW students can register for
**MATH 581 F**. Otherwise please write to one of the instructors to attend the
course as a non-registered student.


## Course Structure

### Part I
Part I is a recap of the basics of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport theory.
_For those of you who are already familiar with basics of OT, this part will be mostly reviews. The lecture videos will be recorded and provided for your review._.
This will be covered between **AUG 29** and **SEP 26**. Topics covered during
this period are:

* linear programming
* Monge-Kantorovich problem
* Kantorovich duality
* Monge-Ampère PDE
* Brenier’s Theorem
* Wasserstein-2 metric

### Part II
This will start on **SEP 27** and continue through **DEC 7**. A rough syllabus
of topics covered are presented below in the order they will be covered. There
might be some changes depending on our progress.


#### core topics
* Wasserstein space
  * metric property
  * geodesics, displacement interpolation, generalized geodesic
  * Geodesic convexity
* AC curves in the Waserstein space and the continuity equation
* Benamou-Brenier and dynamic OT
* Otto calculus
  * tangent spaces to the Wasserstein space
  * Riemannian gradient
* Diffusions as gradient flows via Otto calculus
  * Brownian motion
  * Langevin diffusions

#### Modern research topics that will be surveyed
* log-Sobolev and other functional inequalities
* Convergence of finite dimensional gradient flow of particles to the
  **McKean-Vlasov diffusions** and gradient flow in the Wasserstein space.
* The implicit Euler or JKO scheme
* Entropy regularization and gradient flows
  * Schrödinger bridges
  * Large deviation and gradient flows
* Mirror gradient flows, parabolic Monge-Ampere and the Sinkhorn algorithm
