  Robert McCann is a professor of mathematics and Canada Research Chair in
  Mathematics, Economics and Physics at the University of Toronto.  He is a
  world leader in the vibrant field of optimal transportation, and has played a
  pioneering role in its rapid development since the mid 90's. In particular,
  the notion of displacement convexity, introduced in his PhD thesis, lies
  behind many of the area's myriad applications.  His distinguished research
  record has been recognized with many prestigious awards, including (among
  others) an invited lecture at the 2014 International Congress of
  Mathematicians, election to the Royal Society of Canada in 2014, the 2017
  Jeffery-Williams prize of the Canadian Mathematical Society and the 2023 W.T.
  and Idalia Reid Prize of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
