abstract: |
  The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance quantifies dissimilarity between metric
  measure (mm) spaces and provides a natural alignment between them. As such, it
  serves as a figure of merit for applications involving alignment of
  heterogeneous datasets, including object matching, single-cell genomics, and
  matching language models. While various heuristic methods for approximately
  evaluating the GW distance from data have been developed, formal guarantees for
  such approaches---both statistical and computational---remained elusive. This
  work closes these gaps for the quadratic GW distance between Euclidean mm spaces
  of different dimensions. At the core of our proofs is a novel dual
  representation of the GW problem as an infimum of certain optimal transportation
  problems. The dual form enables deriving, for the first time, sharp empirical
  convergence rates for the GW distance by providing matching upper and lower
  bounds. For computational tractability, we consider the entropically regularized
  GW distance. We derive bounds on the entropic approximation gap, establish
  sufficient conditions for convexity of the objective, and devise efficient
  algorithms with global convergence guarantees. These advancements facilitate
  principled estimation and inference methods for GW alignment problems, that are
  efficiently computable via the said algorithms.
