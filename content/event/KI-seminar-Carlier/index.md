abstract: |
  Entropic optimal transport has received a lot of attention in recent years and
  has become a popular framework for computational optimal transport thanks to
  the Sinkhorn scaling algorithm. In this talk, I will discuss the
  multi-marginal case which arises in different applied contexts in physics,
  economics and machine learning. I will show in particular that the
  multi-marginal Schr√∂dinger system is well posed (joint work with Maxime
  Laborde) and that the multi-marginal Sinkhorn algorithm converges linearly.
