abstract: |
  Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the workhorses of quantum chemistry
  and material science. In principle, the joint probability of finding a
  specific electron configuration in a material is governed by a Schr√∂dinger
  wave equation. But numerically computing this joint probability is
  computationally infeasible, due to the complexity scaling exponentially in the
  number of electrons. DFT aims to circumvent this difficulty by focusing on the
  marginal probability of one electron. In the last decade, a connection was
  found between DFT and a multi-marginal optimal transport problem with a
  repulsive cost. I will give a brief introduction to this topic, including some
  open problems, and recent progress.

### Speaker Biography
Yair Shenfeld is an Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics at Brown
University.  Previously, he was a C.L.E. Moore instructor and an NSF
postdoctoral fellow in the Mathematics department at MIT. He completed his PhD
at Princeton University under the supervision of Ramon van Handel, and received
his B.Sc. from MIT. 

Dr. Shenfeld's work in high-dimensional probability and its interactions with
analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics. His current research interests
include stochastic analysis and functional inequalities, optimal  transport, and
renormalization group methods. He is also interested in extremal problems in
convex geometry.
