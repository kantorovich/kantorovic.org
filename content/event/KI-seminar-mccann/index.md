abstract: |
  While Einstein's theory of gravity is formulated in a smooth setting, the
  celebrated singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose describe many physical
  situations in which this smoothness must eventually breakdown. In
  positive-definite signature, there is a highly successful theory of metric and
  metric-measure geometry which includes Riemannian manifolds as a special case,
  but permits the extraction of nonsmooth limits under dimension and curvature
  bounds analogous to the energy conditions in relativity:  here sectional
  curvature is reformulated through triangle comparison, while and Ricci
  curvature is reformulated using entropic convexity along geodesics of
  probability measures. 

  This lecture explores recent progress in the development of an analogous
  theory in Lorentzian signature, whose ultimate goal is to provide a nonsmooth
  theory of gravity. In work in progress, we aim to establish a low regularity
  splitting theorem by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover
  ellipticity.  We exploit a negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator for
  this purpose. The same technique yields a simplified proof of Eschenberg (1988)
  Galloway (1989) and Newman's (1990) confirmation of Yau's (1982) conjecture,
  bringing all three Lorentzian splitting results into a framework closer to the
  Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.

### Speaker Biography
Robert McCann is a professor of mathematics and Canada Research Chair in
Mathematics, Economics and Physics at the University of Toronto. He is a world
leader in the vibrant field of optimal transportation, and has played a
pioneering role in its rapid development since the mid 90’s. In particular, the
notion of displacement convexity, introduced in his PhD thesis, lies behind
many of the area’s myriad applications. His distinguished research record has
been recognized with many prestigious awards, including (among others) an
invited lecture at the 2014 International Congress of Mathematicians, election
to the Royal Society of Canada in 2014, the 2017 Jeffery-Williams prize of the
Canadian Mathematical Society and the 2023 W.T. and Idalia Reid Prize of the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
