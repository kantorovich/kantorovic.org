abstract: |
  I present the ideas of Stochastic Portfolio Theory in a simple one dimensional
  trading context. Additive functional portfolio generation and multiplicative
  functional generation using a potential are contrasted. The Master Equation
  introduced by Fernholz is described both in discrete time and in continuous
  time. The drift of the Master equation (driving the noise harvesting property
  of functionally generated portfolios) is linked to the concavity of the
  potential function. The link with the dual view of Optimal Transport is made.
  Conditions for the success of functionally generated trading strategies are
  described. A concrete example based on the trading of equity futures is then
  introduced. Historical simulations and their statistical interpretation are
  given. The relationship between functional trading and market making is
  outlined.
