Optimal Transport theory emerged more than two centuries ago as an engineering
problem posed by Gaspard Monge just before the French revolution. Its rich
mathematical structure was first revealed by the Russian Nobel-prize winner
Kantorovich during world War II, and then about 30 years ago by Yann Brenier in
his work on fluid dynamics, Robert McCann in his forays in mathematical physics,
and by Wilfrid Gangbo and Craig Evans who, using PDE methods, eventually solved
the original problem of Monge. Many other breakthroughs followed, led by
Luigi Ambrosio, Felix Otto and their schools leading to the recent Fields medals
for Cedric Villani and Alessio Figalli.

The richness of the theory of optimal transport stems from its central role in
many branches of mathematics, be they theoretical, applied or computational.
Indeed, the basic problem of transporting a probability measure onto another
probability measure, while minimizing a given cost of the transport, is now at
the core of a wide range of problems in mathematics, physics, economics,
statistics, computer science, biology and neuroscience. Recent theoretical and
computational advances have paved the way for major breakthroughs in all these
areas.

The theory of optimal mass transport has had an impact on various classical
branches of mathematics: geometry, analysis, dynamics, partial differential
equations, and fluid mechanics. Since it defines a distance between very general
distributions and entities of various nature, essential for object recognition
and classification, it is now widely investigated in signal processing, machine
learning, weather prediction, neuroscience, computer vision, and astrophysics.
