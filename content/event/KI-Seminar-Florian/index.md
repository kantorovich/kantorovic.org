abstract: |
  Optimal transportation, at its core, is a powerful framework for obtaining structured 
  yet general couplings between general probability measures based on matching underlying
  characteristics. This framework lends itself naturally to applications in causal 
  inference: from matching estimation, to difference-in-differences and synthetic controls 
  approaches, to instrumental variable estimation, just to name a few. In this talk, I will
  provide a non-exhaustive overview of potential applications of optimal transport approaches
  to causal inference. I will focus on providing an overview of general concepts and ideas. 
  
  The talk is based on joint work with Rex Hsieh, Myung Jin Lee, Philippe Rigollet, William 
  Torous, and Yuliang Xu.
