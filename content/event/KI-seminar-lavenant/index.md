abstract: |
  What happens to Wasserstein gradient flows if one uses entropic optimal
  transport instead of classical optimal transport? I will explain why it may be
  relevant to use Sinkhorn divergences, built on entropic optimal transport, as
  they allow the regularization parameter to remain fixed. This leads to the
  study of the Riemannian geometry induced by the Sinkhorn divergences: it
  retains some features of optimal transport geometry while being "smoother."
  The gradient flows of potential energies in this geometry exhibit some
  intriguing features, which I will detail. This is joint work with Mathis
  Hardion, Jonas Luckhardt, Gilles Mordant, Bernhard Schmitzer and Luca
  Tamanini.
