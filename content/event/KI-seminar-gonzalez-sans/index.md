abstract: |
  The quadratically regularized optimal transport problem (QOT) has emerged in
  the literature as a sparse alternative to entropic regularization (EOT).
  Unlike EOT, whose solutions always have full support—even for small
  regularization parameters—QOT solutions, or QOT plans, tend to approximate the
  support of the unregularized transport problem. This raises natural questions:
  Do the supports decrease monotonically? At what rate does this support
  reduction occur? How quickly does the QOT cost converge to the optimal
  transport cost? In this talk, we will review recent theoretical results
  addressing these questions.
